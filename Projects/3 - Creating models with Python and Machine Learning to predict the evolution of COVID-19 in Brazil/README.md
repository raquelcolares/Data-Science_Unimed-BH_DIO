The COVID-19 pandemic is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of China and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 
As of October 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 624 million cases and 6.56 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.

The COVID-19 pandemic reached South America on February 26, 2020 when Brazil confirmed a case in SÃ£o Paulo. On May 22, 2020, citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic. The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by March 21.

Brazil has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and second-highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, behind only those of the United States and of India.

Due to the greater number of cases in Brazil, the purpose of this project was to analyse the covid-19 in Brazil.
